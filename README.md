This project was created for CS360 at SNHU

For this class we were tasked to creating a fully functioning mobile application within andriod studio. 
The application was required to have the following elements

-SQLite for user data and login verification
-Error detection for duplicate dates, incorrect login, and duplicate logins
-User set goals with push notification + a toggle for SMS notifications (non-functional)
-A way for users to input weight and date
-A way for users to modify and delete existing weights
-Change the color from the default, altough specific UI/UX design was not required
