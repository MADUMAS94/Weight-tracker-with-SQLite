Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

My application’s goal was to allow the user to be able to track their daily weight. This application was designed to assist users with their fitness goals by being easy to use and alerting them when that goal is reached.


What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

My application consisted of a login screen, a main screen, and then an add weight and add goal screen. By making these four screens I moved all data input off the main screen, making the user experience uncluttered by delivering the application’s main goal on the main screen. My design was successful because it followed the guidelines of being consistent and easy to use for new and old users. 


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached coding the application in a sectioned approach. I started with one screen, got it working, then moved on to the next. I believe this would have worked better if I made a base skeleton first, as issues did arise when I moved onto the next screen on some occasions. For the future I will make a base application that I can then build off of in sections. 


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I ensured by coding was functional by following the commenting and coding guidelines. I kept my code organized and put reused code into a function that could be called multiple times. This process is important as it makes the code readable later by the original author and any new developers working on the project. 


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

During this project, I made multiple changes to my UI design to ensure that it was consistent and easy to use. Being able to accept and make changes within software development is important so that we can meet a client needs to the best of our ability. UI changes however can cause changes to the code itself, for this project specifically I ended up scrapping an entire database to make my project lighter and easier to manage. 


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe this that I showcased my coding ability during this project, specifically with the CRUD functions for the database. As a new developer I am constantly searching for ways to improve and optimize my code and I believe with the options given to us for this project I was able to accomplish that.
